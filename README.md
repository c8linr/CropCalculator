# Crop Profitability Calculator

<p>For my course, Programming Language Research Project, I'm tasked with learning a new-to-me language in order to build a project of my choice. I decided to learn R by making a crop profitability calculator.</p>
<p>The MVP for the calculator will allow a user to choose a crop and input their location (within Canada). It will then use datasets from the Government of Canada to calculate an estimated profitability per hectare. </p>
